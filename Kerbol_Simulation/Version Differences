Multibody Kerbol Simulation
- Built upon previous simulation with emphasis on scalability, making indexes consistent (i.e. all arrays are same lenght with each index referring to same body, unlike previously)

Version 1:
- Moved Preallocation and Initilizations to beginning of document where possible
- Added Sphere Of Influence (SOI) to body property array
- Changed orbits array to match size of body_prop array
- added reference body to matrices in orbits array to indicate which body the orbital elements are in reference to (i.e. the parent body)
- Made various simulation constants seperate variables for ease of changes
- Cleaned up figure setup
- The trajectory and labels of moons (satelites) will not render until its distance from parent body is greater than SOI (i.e. it has left parent bodies SOI)
