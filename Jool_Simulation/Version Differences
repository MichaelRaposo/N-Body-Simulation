Multibody Joolian Simulation:
- Earliest versions of this project involved simulating Jool and it's Moons from Kerbal Space Program. Each version attempted to improve readability and general form.
- V1 established general form, calculation of initial conditions, and the core simulation loop
- V2 attempted to render the video alongside the simulation, each time a new timestep was simulated a new frame would be rendered
- V3 was the final version of this Joolian simulation before moving onto entire solar system simulation
